# Yacht-Hydrodynamics

I will be using yacht hydrodynamics data from UCI dataset whose link can be find at the end of paragraph. The data focuses on prediction of residuary resistance of sailing yachts at the initial design stage is of a great value for evaluating the ships performance and for estimating the required propulsive power. Essential inputs include the basic hull dimensions and the boat velocity.

The Delft data set comprises 308 full-scale experiments, which were performed at the Delft Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory for that purpose. These experiments include 22 different hull forms, derived from a parent form closely related to the designed by Frans Maas.
